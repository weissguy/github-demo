# github-demo
Demo project to practice essential Git skills.

***0. What Even is a Repository?***
- *Repository* - A location to store all the code for one project.
- For FRC, we make a new repo for every individual robot.
- This repo's name is descriptive and simple (as it should be) -- "github-demo"

***1. Your First Commit***
- *Commit* - An uploaded set of changes to a project, which is permanently stored in Git.
- Commits only store changes since the last commit, NOT entire file contents.

- Steps:
  - Create a new file named "file.txt"
  - Write a few lines of text into the file
  - Save the file
  - Stage changes to the file
  - Commit (with a helpful, detailed message :)
  
***2. Branching Off***
- *Branch* - A separate area of the repository, which stores commits separate from the main branch.
- Branches are useful for developing and testing individual features, subsystems, etc.
  - Rule of thumb is to keep the main branch 100% functional--no new features

- Steps:
  - Create a new branch off of main named "test"
  - Open "file.txt", edit one of the lines of code, and save the file
  - Stage changes to the file
  - Commit to the "test" branch
  
 ***3. Merging Back***
 - Once a branch is fully operational, we can merge it back with the main branch
 - Must issue a pull request when working on a group repository
  - B/c oftentimes conflicts must be resolved
 
 - Steps:
  - Merge "test" with main
  - When prompted to resolve conflicts, save the new code from the "test" branch
